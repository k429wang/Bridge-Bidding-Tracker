# Bridge-Bidding-Tracker

This is an **ongoing** Java project that helps bridge players track bidding systems/conventions. 

Bridge is a fun and interactive card game played by 4 players using a standard 52-card deck. One of the mechanics of Brdige is an auction, or a bidding phase, where players take turns bidding how many tricks they believe they can take with their cards. 

Different bridge players use different bidding systems, so this program acts as a quick and easy way to help bridge players keep track of different systems.

This program will include a Java GUI built using Swing, and a general tree structure to store data inside of a backend database built using MySQL.
